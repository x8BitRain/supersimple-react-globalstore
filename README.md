This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Super Simple React Global Store
[Demo](https://x8bitrain.github.io/supersimple-react-globalstore/)

An example react app that uses [react-context-global-store](https://github.com/eleme/react-context-global-store) to enable a really basic global store for beginners to React.
It doesn't have actions or reducers or anything fancy that Redux does, it's basically a global version of a state.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`
